	<h1>Reconstructing the People: Populism and Political Change in Post-Crisis Spain and Portugal</h1>
	<div class="container">

	<p><strong>Spain and Portugal are two southern European democracies whose parallel histories have often 
		warranted comparative case study research. Yet in the wake of the political crisis of the 2010s, they presented
		an intriguing puzzle</strong>. Namely, Spain has seen an effervescence of new political movements,
		populist politics, and ultimately a profound reshaping of the political system. Whereas in Portugal, widespread
		discontent in the wake of the financial crisis has been followed by political disengagement and politics-as-usual among elites.</p>
		
	<p>Previous research has been unable to make sense of these puzzling differences, and I argue that these shortcomings 
		reflect inconsistencies in how we study populism more broadly. Namely, <strong>the study of populism has been characterised
		by the paradoxical absence of <i>the</i> people</strong>. Scholarship has rarely explored how populism actually looks from the standpoint of ordinary citizens,
		or how citizens exercise agency in channelling populism through multiple forms of participation. Seeking
		to go beyond existing approaches, in this research I develop a bottom-up approach to populism, foregrounding the lived experience of 
		discontent citizens, their views, and the meanings of their political participation. Doing so was not only
		important to address the research puzzle, but also to accommodate ongoing developments, such as the recent rise of the populist right
		in Portugal which further "puzzled" the puzzle. <strong>In turn, taking the Spain/Portugal puzzle
		as a case study, I leverage this original approach to 
		inform established theories and preconceptions about peoplehood and populism</strong>.</p>
		
	<p><strong>The book is grounded in extensive fieldwork over more than a year across 
		four sites in Spain and Portugal. It builds on data from 90 in-depth interviews with discontent citizens,
		as well as ethnographic observation and multiple interviews with civic organisations, stakeholders, etc.</strong>
		The analysis makes four key theoretical contributions to the literature. First, I argue 
	that populist discontent is rooted in factors that are more structural (the logics of party politics, 
the increasing complexity and fragmentation of society) than the qualities of elites or the unsatisfaction 
of specific demands, which are the focus of prior scholarship. I build on this empirical argument to 
propose <strong>a new framework for theorising populism and peoplehood that pushes beyond limitations in prior 
	scholarship</strong>. Second, I argue that <strong>the populist right is successful not because of 
nationalism, but because it builds on social resentment that reproduces neoliberal discourses of 
self-reliance and distrust</strong>. Third, I argue that <strong>ordinary citizens channel populism by developing and exercising new norms of how democratic peoplehood 
		should work</strong>, shaped by the everyday experience of specific rural/urban ecologies and interactional patterns.  
		Fourth, following up on the previous point, I argue that left populism is an avenue for channelling discontent, 
		but also that <strong>populist left supporters prefer extra-institutional forms of participation that better embody their ideas of “good” peoplehood</strong>. 
		Overall, <strong>the book raises the need to rethink central aspects of modern democracy</strong> (party politics, national peoplehood, electoral law, etc.) 
	with normative implications for political action and institutional reform.</p>
		
	<p>Through these findings, I address the research puzzle of Spain and Portugal in two ways. On the one hand,
		I argue that Portuguese citizens rooted discontent with democracy in social, rather than institutional,
		dynamics. That is, populist discontent in Portugal was rooted more in an incapacity to experience "the" people at all as an actual
		sovereign, owing to social behaviours and norms that created social distrust and negative expectations of fellow citizens, and which 
		were largely regarded as inherent in Portuguese society. Whereas in Spain, institutional dynamics were more central to make sense of why
		citizens felt the people were deprived from exercising true sovereignty, while Spanish society was experienced as a reservoir for changing
		what is wrong about democracy from the bottom up.
		<strong>In short, populism can take shape differently across different contexts, making it possible to explain what appear as puzzling political outcomes</strong>.
		On the other hand, I address the puzzle by problematising it: neither does a lack of electoral participation in Portugal
		imply no populist politics existed (rather, it took shape in social and civic participation), nor does the success of populist
		parties in Spain reflect a complete "satisfaction" of populist discontent (rather, Spanish citizens longed for a different <i>way</i>
		of doing politics that they rarely saw reflected in populist parties). Finally, for the reasons outlined above, I argue that 
		it is only in relative terms that one can see populist right support as a form of <i>populist</i> politics, given populist right
		supporters showcased little desire or aspiration to reclaim the popular sovereignty they felt deprived from.
		<strong>That is, a bottom-up approach serves to question assumptions in how we conceptualise populism from the top down, showing the importance
		of pushing scholarship beyond a focus on party politics and on constrained concepts of what populism is</strong>.</p>

            <div class="caption">Panoramic view of the town of Elvas, Portalegre, Portugal (picture by the author). The dishevelled state of
	    housing and public infrastructure stands as a reflection of a dwindling, declining rural society. In my research, I 
	    argue bottom-up change in rural communities in Portugal is hampered by this lack of civic capital, derived largely
	    from the reproduction of cultural repertoires that promoted social
	    distrust. The case of Portalegre illustrates my argument that the way peoplehood is constructed creates frameworks for diagnosing 
		    political ills (in this case, endogenously) which could make electoral populism nonsensical. In turn, this lack of social energies made it possible for partisan organisations to co-opt existing civic spacces.</div>

	 primarily citizens associated to the postcolonial diaspora. The flags decorating the entrance to the 
	    Centro reflect the diversity of origin countries of the children that use the space. As I show in my analysis of populist right supporters,
	    minorities and immigrants became a key target of resentment not (only) for their problematisation of cultural homogeneity, but more fundamentally for 
	    symbolising the universality of social rights that these respondents wished to challenge. They way that immigrants were constructed
	    by populist right supporters is key to put forward my argument that populist right politics is chiefly not about refurbishing a traditional peoplehood,
	    but about undoing it altogether through neoliberal politics.</div>

            <div class="caption">View of the western boundary of the city of Teruel, Teruel, Spain (picture by the author). Standing out for its
	    remarkably low population density (one of the lowest in Europe), the province of Teruel has in its capital city a reservoir of 
	    committed, highly-organised civic life that is the root of its successful rural populist party, "Teruel Exists." In my research
	    I show the stark differences between the city and its sparsely populated surroundings were a key challenge to sustain populist momentum.
		The success of "Teruel Exists" serves as a case study to show populist politics relies not only on the articulation of different demands, but also on 
		the construction of new ideas and performances of peoplehood. At once, however, the subsequent decline of the party can be understood as a result of 
		 the centrality of said performances, which blocked the possibility of more ambitious political goals.</div>
