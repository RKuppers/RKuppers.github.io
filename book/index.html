    <h1>Reconstructing the People: Populism and Political Change in Post-Crisis Spain and Portugal</h1>

	<p>Spain and Portugal are two Southern European democracies whose parallel histories have often 
		warranted comparative case-study research. Yet in the wake of the “populist decade” they 
		have presented widely divergent paths: whereas in Spain new forms of contestation and populist 
		politics have reshaped the political system, in Portugal prior trends of political apathy have remained 
		largely unchanged (at once, the puzzle has been further “puzzled” by the sudden rise of the populist 
		right). Previous research has been unable to make sense of these events, and I argue these shortcomings 
		reflect fundamental inconsistencies in how we study populism. Namely, the study of populism is characterised
		by a paradoxical sidelining of the identities behind identity politics. Such an empirical puzzle 
		called for a new approach, and offered therefore an ideal comparative case-study to inform existing theories of populism.</p>
	
	<p>In this project, I explore Spanish and Portuguese peoplehood from the bottom up,
	foregrounding the lived experience of peoplehood to make sense of how discontent citizens view politics and how
	they channel said discontent in widely divergent ways. The results are based on more than a year of fieldwork across 
	four sites in Spain and Portugal. It builds on data from 93 interviews with citizens,
	as well as ethnographic observation and multiple interviews with civic organisations, stakeholders, etc.</p>

	<p>Building on the exploration of the puzzle, this research makes three key contributions to the literature. 
	First, it proposes <strong>a new framework for theorising populism and peoplehood that pushes beyond limitations in prior 
	scholarship</strong>. Second, <strong>the findings challenge conventions in scholarship and point to unexplored dimensions of populist 
	politics</strong>. For instance, I foreground such the ideological and organisational determinants of politics as a
	key factor of discontent, and the salience of everyday life as a political outlet. My analysis also offers original insights
	and hypotheses regarding the support bases of the populist left and right: whereas I show left populist respondents are more
	oriented to non-institutional forms of political realisation, I argue supporters of the populist right are not "nativist" but
	fundamentally concerned with curtailing obligations to society. Third, <strong>my analysis raises the need to rethink central aspects of modern democracy</strong> (party politics, national peoplehood, electoral law, etc.) 
	with normative implications for political action and institutional reform.</p>

	<p>By improving our understanding 
		of the political significance of collective identities from a bottom-up perspective, the aim is not only to unveil the 
		micro-level determinants of phenomena such as populism, but also to illuminate shifting macro-structural trends of (post)modern 
		politics.</p>

	<p><i>The project that gave rise to these results received the support of a fellowship from ‘la Caixa’ Foundation [ID 100010434]. The fellowship code is LCF/BQ/EU21/ 11890039.</i></p>
