	<h1>Reconstructing the People: Populism and Political Change in Post-Crisis Spain and Portugal</h1>
	<div class="container">

	<p><strong>Spain and Portugal are two southern European democracies whose parallel histories have often 
		warranted comparative case study research. Yet in the wake of the political crisis of the 2010s, they constituted
		an intriguing puzzle that was the seed of my doctoral research</strong>. Namely, despite similar contexts
		across a variety of relevant dimension, throughout the “populist decade” Spain saw an effervescence of new political movements,
		populist politics, and ultimately a profound reshaping of the political system. Whereas in Portugal, widespread
		discontent in the wake of the financial crisis was followed by political disengagement and politics-as-usual among elites.
		
	<p>Previous research has been unable to make sense of these puzzling differences, and I argue that these shortcomings 
		reflect fundamental inconsistencies in how we study populism more broadly. Namely, <strong>the study of populism has been characterised
		by a paradoxical sidelining of <i>the</i> people</strong>, meaning how populism actually looks from the standpoint of ordinary citizens,
		and how citizens exercise agency in channelling their discontent in multiple ways (and beyond electoral participation). Seeking
		to go beyond existing approaches to populism, in this research I develop a bottom-up approach to populism, foregrounding the lived experience of 
		discontent citizens, their views, and the meanings of their political participation (or lack thereof). Doing so was not only
		important to address the research puzzle, but also to accommodate ongoing developments, chiefly the recent rise of the populist right
		in Portugal which further "puzzled" the puzzle, into a comprehensive explanatory theory. <strong>In turn, taking the Spain/Portugal puzzle
		as an ideal case study to go beyond inconsistencies in existing scholarship, I leverage this original approach to 
		inform established theories and preconceptions about peoplehood and populism</strong>.
		
		<p><strong>The findings are grounded in extensive fieldwork over more than a year across 
	four sites in Spain and Portugal. The resulting analysis builds on data from 90 in-depth interviews with discontent citizens,
	as well as ethnographic observation and multiple interviews with civic organisations, stakeholders, etc.</strong></p>

	<p>Building on the exploration of the puzzle, this research makes three key contributions to the literature. 
	First, it proposes <strong>a new framework for theorising populism and peoplehood that pushes beyond limitations in prior 
	scholarship</strong>. Second, <strong>the findings challenge conventions in scholarship and point to unexplored dimensions of populist 
	politics</strong>. For instance, I foreground such the ideological and organisational determinants of politics as a
	key factor of discontent, and the salience of everyday life as a political outlet. My analysis also offers original insights
	and hypotheses regarding the support bases of the populist left and right: whereas I show left populist respondents are more
	oriented to non-institutional forms of political realisation, I argue supporters of the populist right are not "nativist" but
	fundamentally concerned with curtailing obligations to society. Third, <strong>my analysis raises the need to rethink central aspects of modern democracy</strong> (party politics, national peoplehood, electoral law, etc.) 
	with normative implications for political action and institutional reform.</p>


		Building on the exploration of this empirical puzzle through original in-depth interview data, 
I make four key contributions to the literature across four empirical chapters. First, I argue 
populist discon-tent is rooted in factors that are more structural (the logics of party politics, 
the increasing complexi-ty and fragmentation of society) than the qualities of elites or the unsatisfaction 
of specific demands, which are the focus of prior scholarship. I build on this empirical argument to 
propose a new theory of populism that addresses gaps in prior frameworks. This chapter is planned for
submission to APSR before 2026. Second, I argue the populist right is successful not because of 
nationalism, but because it builds on social resentment that reproduces neoliberal discourses of 
self-reliance and dis-trust. This chapter will soon be ready for submission to Perspectives on Politics. 
Third, I argue that left populism is an avenue for channelling discontent, but also that their supporters 
prefer extra-institutional forms of participation. Fourth, I argue that ordinary citizens channel populism 
by de-veloping and practising new norms of how peoplehood should work, shaped by social ecologies and interactional 
patterns.  

	<p>By improving our understanding 
		of the political significance of collective identities from a bottom-up perspective, the aim is not only to unveil the 
		micro-level determinants of phenomena such as populism, but also to illuminate shifting macro-structural trends of (post)modern 
		politics.</p>

            <div class="caption">Panoramic view of the town of Elvas, Portalegre, Portugal (picture by the author). The dishevelled state of
	    housing and public infrastructure stands as a reflection of a dwindling, declining rural society. In my research, I 
	    argue bottom-up change in rural communities in Portugal is hampered by this lack of civic capital, derived largely
	    from the reproduction of cultural repertoires that promoted social
	    distrust. The case of Portalegre illustrates my argument that the way peoplehood is constructed creates frameworks for diagnosing 
		    political ills (in this case, endogenously) which could make electoral populism nonsensical. In turn, this lack of social energies made it possible for partisan organisations to co-opt existing civic spacces.</div>

	 primarily citizens associated to the postcolonial diaspora. The flags decorating the entrance to the 
	    Centro reflect the diversity of origin countries of the children that use the space. As I show in my analysis of populist right supporters,
	    minorities and immigrants became a key target of resentment not (only) for their problematisation of cultural homogeneity, but more fundamentally for 
	    symbolising the universality of social rights that these respondents wished to challenge. They way that immigrants were constructed
	    by populist right supporters is key to put forward my argument that populist right politics is chiefly not about refurbishing a traditional peoplehood,
	    but about undoing it altogether through neoliberal politics.</div>

            <div class="caption">View of the western boundary of the city of Teruel, Teruel, Spain (picture by the author). Standing out for its
	    remarkably low population density (one of the lowest in Europe), the province of Teruel has in its capital city a reservoir of 
	    committed, highly-organised civic life that is the root of its successful rural populist party, "Teruel Exists." In my research
	    I show the stark differences between the city and its sparsely populated surroundings were a key challenge to sustain populist momentum.
		The success of "Teruel Exists" serves as a case study to show populist politics relies not only on the articulation of different demands, but also on 
		the construction of new ideas and performances of peoplehood. At once, however, the subsequent decline of the party can be understood as a result of 
		 the centrality of said performances, which blocked the possibility of more ambitious political goals.</div>
