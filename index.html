    <p><strong>Hi!</strong></p>
    <p>I am a PhD researcher in the Department of Methodology at LSE <br>
        and a Fellow of the La Caixa Foundation.
        You can check my <br> institutional page <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Research-Students/Roni-Küppers/Roni-Küppers">here</a>.
        Previously I worked as a research assitant <br> at the Open University
        of Catalonia (UOC), I also worked in a <br> project on social solidarity in contexts of 
        high cultural diversity <br> commissioned by the Barcelona City Council to the Centre <br> for International Relations (CIDOB).</p>
    <p>My work is structured around an overarching fascination with <strong>the links between collective identity 
        and political participation, the way they feed into each other, and how these links explain 
        our capacity to imagine and enact political change</strong>. The broader objective is to understand and address the 
        challenge of materialising the fundamental human capacity to bond, coalesce, and collaborate, in a context of increasing
        social complexity and mounting global challenges. <strong>At present, I develop this work in the areas of nationalism, peoplehood/populism, and gender</strong>.</p> 
    <p>At an empirical level, this work has taken shape in both quantitative and qualitative projects 
        concerned with <strong>understanding how populism is grounded in collective identities, 
        and what implications these identities have more broadly for political change</strong>. For example, 
        <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/10659129251318314">my most recent paper</a> uses new methods in the field of populism
        to explore how peoplehood takes shape among ordinary citizens, and how said configurations are associated to supporting populism.</p>
    <p>At a theoretical level, building on my empirical research, <strong>I engage with theories on the changing relations of self and society in 
        (post)modern times</strong>. I explore how their assumptions compare to empirical data, and how their normative proposals might enable/hamper social and political solidarity.</p>
    <p>At a methodological level, I explore how methodological innovation can tackle current challenges in the field and bring closer empirical and theoretical debates. 
        In this line, <strong>I am particularly interested in how our methods impact our ontologies of society and viceversa, and therefore the theories we build</strong>. 
        In my <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23254823.2024.2321905">a recent paper</a>, 
        for instance, I build on original data to propose the debate on the causes 
        of populism is conceptually biased, structuring the academic conversation itself in a way that hampers our capacity to understand its causes.</p>
