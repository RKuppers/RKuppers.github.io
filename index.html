    <p><strong>Hi!</strong></p>
        <br>
        <br>
    <p>I am a PhD researcher in the Department of Methodology at LSE
        and a Fellow of the La Caixa Foundation.
        You can check my institutional page <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Research-Students/Roni-Küppers/Roni-Küppers">here</a>.
        Previously I worked as a research assitant at the Open University
        of Catalonia (UOC). I also previously worked in a project on social solidarity in contexts of 
        high cultural diversity, commissioned by the Barcelona City Council to the Centre for International Relations (CIDOB).</p>
    <p>My work stems from an overarching fascination with how group bonds take shape in increasingly complex social contexts.
        Specificaly, my work studies <strong>the relationship between collective identity 
        and political participation, and how this relationship can explain 
        our capacity to imagine and enact political change in a context of mounting global challenges</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>At present, I develop this work in the field of peoplehood and populism, as well as nationalism and gender, and with a 
        focus on West European countries (particularly, Spain and Portugal)</strong>.</p> 
     <p>Theoretically, <strong>I approach populism as a form of political identity that challenges theories on on the changing relations 
         between self and society in (post)modern times</strong>. The objective is to better explain populist politics, but also to use populism
         as a critical symptom through which we can address two pressing questions: the status of democratic peoplehood in contemporary Western societies,
         and the possibilities for its renewal in the face of mounting dissatisfaction.</p>
    <p>Methodologically, this research agenda has taken shape both quantitatively and qualitatively. It has also pushed me to
        explore <strong>how methodological innovation can tackle current challenges in approaching identity politics, and in linking 
        our empirical findings to broader theoretical debates</strong>. In 
        <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23254823.2024.2321905">this article on the Spanish far right</a>, 
        for instance, I build on original data and methods to challenge how the debate on the causes of populism is structured.
        I show the current debate fits empircal data into stringent binaries that fail to represent the workings of populism, and which 
        prevent us from theorising the social implications of rising far right politics.</p>
     <p>Empirically, my current work focuses on <strong>understanding peoplehood and populism as collective identities, 
        and the implications that these identities have for social life and political change</strong>. My <a href="book.html">book project</a>,
        which is the result of my doctoral thesis, studies peoplehood and populism from the bottom up in Spain and Portugal, seeking to explain puzzling divergences that
         animate theoretical innovation. In another example, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/10659129251318314">my most recent article</a> uses new methods in the field of populism
        to explore how peoplehood takes shape among ordinary citizens, and how said configurations are associated to supporting populism.</p>
