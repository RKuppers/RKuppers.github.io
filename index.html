	<p><strong>Hi!</strong></p>
	
	<p>I am a PhD researcher in the Department of Methodology at LSE. <br> 
		You can check my institutional page <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Research-Students/Roni-Küppers/Roni-Küppers">here</a>.</p>
<p>My work is structured around an overarching fascination with <strong>the links between collective identity 
	and political participation, the way they feed into each other, and how these links explain 
	our capacity to imagine/enact political change</strong>. The broader objective is to understand and address the 
	challenge of materialising the fundamental human capacity to bond, coalesce, and collaborate, in a context of increasing
	social complexity and mounting global challenges.</p>
<p>At an empirical level, this work has taken shape in various ways using both quantitative and qualitative methods: 
	for instance, <strong>my PhD research is concerned with understanding how populism is grounded in collective identities, 
	and what implications these identities have more broadly for political change</strong>.
<p>At a theoretical level, I build on this empirical work 
In my most recent paper, for instance, I build on original data to propose the structure of the debate on the causes
of populism is misguided and hampers our capacity to understand its causes.</p>
<p>and methodological level, partly building on my empirical research, I explore questions regarding how
	our 
	and how our methods impact our ontologies of society and viceversa (and therefore the theories we build).</p>
</p>
<p>This work has been made possible by a La Caixa Foundation fellowship (2021-2024).</p>
