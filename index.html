        <h1>Roni Küppers</h1> 
 <p><strong>Hello!</strong></p>
    <p>I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology">Department of Methodology at the LSE</a>
        (submitted) and a Fellow of the <a href="https://lacaixafoundation.org/en">La Caixa Foundation</a>.
        You can check out my <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Research-Students/Roni-Küppers/Roni-Küppers">LSE page</a> and 
        my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fMcxhvgAAAAJ&hl=es">Google Scholar</a>.
        Previously I worked as a research assitant at the Open University
        of Catalonia (UOC). I also previously worked in a project on social solidarity in contexts of 
        high cultural diversity, commissioned by the Barcelona City Council to the 
        <a href="https://www.cidob.org">Centre for International Relations (CIDOB)</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>My work focuses on the relationship between collective identities 
        and political participation</strong>, and how this relationship can explain 
        our capacity (or, incapacity) to imagine and enact political change. In a context of mounting 
        systemic challenges, from structural political discontent to chronic inequalities, 
        the need for change is increasingly related to rethinking the political foundations: <i>who</i> we are, <i>how</i> we are, 
        and what we <i>aspire to be</i> (as nations, as democratic societies, etc.), with crucial implications for politics in the 21st century.</p>    
    <p><strong>At present, I develop this work in the fields of peoplehood/populism, nationalism, and gender, and with a 
        focus on West Europe (particularly, Spain and Portugal)</strong>. I employ qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods approaches, 
        chiefly in-depth interviewing, case-study designs, and multivariate statistics.</p> 
     <p><strong>My doctoral thesis, now a <a href="book/">book project</a>, studies peoplehood and populism 
         from the perspective of ordinary citizens in Spain and Portugal</strong>. This research stemmed 
         from an intriguing puzzle in recent years concerning two countries that 
         have been widely regarded as "comparable" societies: despite similar socioeconomic and institutional 
         contexts, the “populist decade” has seen rising populism and severe instability in Spain, while 
         political disengagement and politics-as-usual have been the norm in Portugal. Employing extensive
         original data from in-depth interviews and ethnographic observation, the book explores 
         this empirical puzzle by explaining the meaning and implications of different ways of channelling 
         political discontent, and building on these findings to inform established theories and preconceptions about peoplehood and populism. 
         To do so, I develop an innovative approach to populism that seeks to push beyond gaps in existing scholarship.
         <strong>The objective of innovation is to better explain populist politics, and also to address two broader questions 
         of critical importance: what is the status of democratic peoplehood in societies of growing complexity? 
         And does rising populist discontent contain the potential for transforming democratic politics?</strong></p>
