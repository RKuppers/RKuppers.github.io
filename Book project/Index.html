    <h2 style="font-size: 2em;">1. Populism in Spain and Portugal: how do collective identities explain divergent outcomes?</h2>
	<p>Spain and Portugal are two countries that have faced similar exogenous economic shocks and political crises, yet have seen
	widely divergent political outcomes in the past decades, especially with regards to populist politics. <strong>While broader theories in
	populism cannot explain these divergences, I argue more broadly that the problem lies in a lack of interpretive insight: in other
	words, we are trying to study and explain identity politics without accounting for those identities</strong>. In this project, I exploit an
	intriguing comparative case to do precisely that: to grasp how the way peoplehood is constructed explains political outcomes ---and 
	specifically what potential for transformation lies in populism as a response to contexts of crisis.</p>
		<p>By improving our understanding 
		of the political significance of collective identities from a bottom-up perspective, the aim is not only to unveil the 
		micro-level determinants of phenomena such as populism, but also to illuminate shifting macro-structural trends of (post)modern 
		politics.</p>
	<p>Building on a year of fieldwork in both countries, I am currently in the process of writing up my findings to be submitted
	as a doctoral thesis, and look forward to making a book proposal in the near future.</p>
	<p><i>The project that gave rise to these results received the support of a fellowship from ‘la Caixa’ Foundation [ID 100010434]. The fellowship code is LCF/BQ/EU21/ 11890039.</i></p>
