    <h1>Work in progress</h1>

<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">1. Modelling populism: how can we analyse peoplehood and populism quantitatively while accounting for complexity?</h2>
	<p>Current studies have made immense progress in the comparative study of populism, yet breadth has come at the expense
	of depth. Beyond the idea that democratic dissatisfaction is widespread, we know little about the way ordinary people engage 
	with the idea of <i>the people</i>, and whether this is consequential to their attitudes and behaviours. <strong>Building on innovative
	methods and original data, I explore ways of applying Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to address this question in a way that
	balances comparative generalisation with attention to meaning and heterogeneity</strong>.</p>
	<p><i>The project that gave rise to these results received the support of a fellowship from ‘la Caixa’ Foundation [ID 100010434]. The fellowship code is LCF/BQ/EU21/ 11890039.</i></p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 2em;">3. Critical theory and emancipatory politics: how can the concepts and methods of critical theory produce emancipatory outcomes?</h2>
	<p>Academic discourse has historically fluctuated from celebrating to dismissing the transformative potential of contemporary political innovations 
	(for instance, the alt-globalisation movement or populism). But often either position is driven by an excessive privileging of inductive
	perspectives or of deductive conceptual impositions, making it hard to feedback academic and social discourses productively. 
		Specifically, I address this problem from two different angles:</p>
	
	<p>· <strong>Studying the empirical prevalence of expectations and ideas of change, revolution, utopia, etc. among ordinary citizens</strong>, and the extent to which they might correspond to or contest
	theoretical understandings of the transformative potential of late-modern societies.</p>
 	<p>· <strong>Assessing the implications, potentials, and possible downsides of the correspondence between social and academic concepts/tools for emancipation</strong>
	(for instance, <i>gender identity)</i>.</p>
