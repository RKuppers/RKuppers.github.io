    <h2>1. Populism in Spain and Portugal: how do collective identities explain divergent outcomes?</h2>
	<p>Spain and Portugal are two countries that have faced similar exogenous economic shocks and political crises, yet have seen
	widely divergent political outcomes in the past decades, especially with regards to populist politics. While broader theories in
	populism cannot explain these divergences, I argue more broadly that the problem lies in a lack of interpretive insight: in other
	words, we are trying to study and explain identity politics without accounting for those identities. In this project, I exploit an
	intriguing comparative case to do precisely that: to grasp how the way peoplehood is constructed explains political outcomes ---and 
	specifically what potential for transformation lies in populism as a response to contexts of crisis.</p>
	<p>The project that gave rise to these results received the support of a fellowship from ‘la Caixa’ Foundation [ID 100010434]. The fellowship code is [LCF/BQ/EU21/ 11890039].</p>
