    <h2>1. Populism in Spain and Portugal: how do collective identities explain divergent outcomes?</h2>
	<p>Spain and Portugal are two countries that have faced similar exogenous economic shocks and political crises, yet have seen
	widely divergent political outcomes in the past decades, especially with regards to populist politics. <strong>While broader theories in
	populism cannot explain these divergences, I argue more broadly that the problem lies in a lack of interpretive insight: in other
	words, we are trying to study and explain identity politics without accounting for those identities</strong>. In this project, I exploit an
	intriguing comparative case to do precisely that: to grasp how the way peoplehood is constructed explains political outcomes ---and 
	specifically what potential for transformation lies in populism as a response to contexts of crisis.</p>
		<p>By improving our understanding 
		of the political significance of collective identities from a bottom-up perspective, the aim is not only to unveil the 
		micro-level determinants of phenomena such as populism, but also to illuminate shifting macro-structural trends of (post)modern 
		politics.</p>

<h2>2. Modelling peoplehood: how can we analyse identities quantitatively while accounting for complexity?</h2>
	<p>Current studies have made immense progress in the comparative study of populism, yet breadth has come at the expense
	of depth. Beyond the idea that democratic dissatisfaction is widespread, we know little about the way ordinary people engage 
	with the idea of <i>the people</i>, and whether this is consequential to their attitudes and behaviours. <strong>Building on innovative
	methods in other disciplines, I explore ways of applying Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to address this question in a way that
	balances comparative generalisation with attention to meaning and heterogeneity</strong>.</p>

    <h2>3. Critical theory and emancipatory politics: how can the concepts and methods of critical theory produce emancipatory outcomes?</h2>
	<p>Academic discourse has historically fluctuated from celebrating to dismissing the transformative potential of contemporary political innovations 
	(for instance, the alt-globalisation movement or populism). But often either position is driven by an excessive privileging of inductive
	perspectives or of deductive conceptual impositions, making it hard to feedback academic and social discourses productively. Specifically, I address this problem from two different angles:</p>
	 <ol>
        <li>The empirical prevalence of ideas of revolution, utopia, etc. among ordinary citizens, and the extent to which they might correspond to or contest
	theoretical understandings of the transformative potential of late-modern societies.</li>
 	<li>The implications, potentials, and possible downsides of the correspondence between social and academic concepts or tools for emancipation
	(chiefly regarding gender).</li>
    	</ol>
	
    <h2>4. Mediations between ontology and epistemology: how do methodological biases or assumptions shape the way we see the world?</h2>
	<p>The question of the researcher's "gaze" is a longstanding concern in social sciences. However, while we are mostly concerned with 
	the broad power structures reproduced in academic theories, we have been less attentive to the effects of endogenous methodological 
	dynamics. Approaching academia as a particular "economy of signs" (Baudrillard), <strong>I am interested in gauging how and why theories, methods 
	and research praxis may become systemically misaligned, what this can reveal about the relation between ontology and epistemology in 
	the academic field, and what implications this can have for the theories that we are able to imagine or enunciate</strong>.</p>
