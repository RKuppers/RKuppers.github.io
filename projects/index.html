    <h2>1. Populism in Spain and Portugal: how do collective identities explain divergent outcomes?</h2>
	<p>Spain and Portugal are two countries that have faced similar exogenous economic shocks and political crises, yet have seen
	widely divergent political outcomes in the past decades, especially with regards to populist politics. <strong>While broader theories in
	populism cannot explain these divergences, I argue more broadly that the problem lies in a lack of interpretive insight: in other
	words, we are trying to study and explain identity politics without accounting for those identities</strong>. In this project, I exploit an
	intriguing comparative case to do precisely that: to grasp how the way peoplehood is constructed explains political outcomes ---and 
	specifically what potential for transformation lies in populism as a response to contexts of crisis.</p>
		<p>By improving our understanding 
		of the political significance of collective identities from a bottom-up perspective, the aim is not only to unveil the 
		micro-level determinants of phenomena such as populism, but also to illuminate shifting macro-structural trends of (post)modern 
		politics.</p>
	<p>The project that gave rise to these results received the support of a fellowship from ‘la Caixa’ Foundation [ID 100010434]. The fellowship code is [LCF/BQ/EU21/ 11890039].</p>

<h2>2. Modelling peoplehood: how can we analyse identities quantitatively while accounting for complexity?</h2>
	<p>Current studies have made immense progress in the comparative study of populism, yet breadth has come at the expense
	of depth. Beyond the idea that democratic dissatisfaction is widespread, we know little about the way ordinary people engage 
	with the idea of <i>the people</i>, and whether this is consequential to their attitudes and behaviours. <strong>Building on innovative
	methods in other disciplines, I explore ways of applying Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to address this question in a way that
	balances comparative generalisation with attention to meaning and heterogeneity</strong>.</p>

    <h2>3. Critical theory and emancipatory politics: how can the concepts and methods of critical (discourse) theory produce emancipatory outcomes?</h2>
	
    <h2>4. Mediations between ontology and epistemology: how do methodological biases or assumptions shape the way we see the world?</h2>
	<p>The question of the researcher's "gaze" is a longstanding concern in social sciences. However,</p>
